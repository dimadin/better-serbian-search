Better Serbian Search is a plugin for WordPress that changes search string so that it searches for any variant of a string in Serbian language.

For example, string "Ђоковић" can also be written as "Ðokovic", "Djokovic", "Djokovic", or some variation of those.

It alters default WordPress search no matter in which language WordPress installation is. Note that it finds variants for every search string, even those that shouldn't be searched for it's variants.

If you need to use it in multilingual site or you have custom search, please review source code of this plugin or of [`Serbian_Variants`](https://github.com/dimadin/serbian-variants) class it uses.

Better Serbian Search is very lightweight, it has no settings, just activate it and it works immediately.
